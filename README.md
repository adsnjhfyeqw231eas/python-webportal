6. run app with:-
install a Linux on WSL: run a docker ubuntu 24/22 inside it
inside docker: do git clone this project and do the following.
Install python3 and  python3-pip 
then run command 1: python3-pip install flask
then run command 2: python3 app.py
Note: all html folders must be inside templates/ folder, I am not sure about css/images folders placements.
python flask's home.html is the replacement for php's index.html.
